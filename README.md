Evolution of system
==============

Solve the differential equation for the evolution of objects orbiting around a body, the differential equation is given by the gravity interaction, the interaction between each of the small bodies is negligible. We use C for computing the evolution of the system via RungeKutta Method, Then Plotting using Python, and linking both processes via a Makefile.
